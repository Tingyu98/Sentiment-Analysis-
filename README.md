Problem statement 

Our objective is to identify the types of businesses that are exceptionally liked and frequented by Yelp users (finding positive trends and outliers) based on words used in Yelp reviews. To do this, we would use natural language processing tools to categorize positive or negative business reviews on Yelp, and observing if specific words or phrases can foretell a successful business. Ideally, we will then aspire to create an algorithm that can effectively automate this process and adapt to new data inputs.
