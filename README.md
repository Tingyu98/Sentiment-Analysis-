# Sentiment-Analysis-
DATA 5100 project

Member: Duong, Priyanka, Ting-Yu 


## Problem statement 

Our objective is to identify the types of businesses that are exceptionally liked and frequented by Yelp users (finding positive trends and outliers) based on words used in Yelp reviews. To do this, we would use natural language processing tools to categorize positive or negative business reviews on Yelp, and observing if specific words or phrases can foretell a successful business. Ideally, we will then aspire to create an algorithm that can effectively automate this process and adapt to new data inputs.  


## Data sources 

The Kaggle folder contains 5 json files that display information about the business, check-in, review, tip and user. We will perform a minimal amount of cleaning, but preprocessing is necessary due to its size and to select relevant variables. The datasets will need to be combined to create a comprehensive single dataset.

## Analytical approach 

The steps include preprocessing, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), and training the data through regression analysis to ascertain the sentiment of reviews, although this necessitates further research and discussion. 

## Solution technologies 

Pandas and NumPy will serve as the primary tools for data manipulation and cleaning. We will utilize Seaborn for data visualization. NLTK will be employed for natural language processing tasks. 

## Challenge 

Reading and merging json files. 

Dealing with the dataset's size. 

Determining the scale of the analysis. 

Understanding the technical elements behind training the data to understand positive or negative words 

Conduct tests to see how reliable our models would be 

Defining what “success” for a business might look like to have a training basis for the dataset (e.g. would the word “exceptional” in a review be a precursor to a business with more than 5,000 reviews or 4.5 stars?)

Next step: We will conduct the initial data cleaning, and we will split the dataset, with each person responsible for a portion while simultaneously performing data cleaning.
